Project to learn go and vim motions :)

## Some notes:

### AOC related:
* 2023 starts off a lot harder than 2024

### Go related
* Go seems very verbose. Stuff that can be done in a few lines of python
take quite a lot of lines in go
* I miss anonymous function from scala / lambda functions from python
* The forced error handling seems like a good practice. I hope it does not get annoying
